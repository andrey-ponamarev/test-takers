## Overview

Project is written on typescript and using `nextjs` as framework. Used `Redux` for keeping application state. To make components looks awesome the project is using `material-ui` and `styled-components`. Components could be easily replaced to any other type of components.

## Development

To run project locally setup all dependency and execute next command

```
yarn run dev
```

## How it works

Appication contains 3 main components:
![Alt text](docs/images/components.png)

#### `<Search />`

Represent seacrh input.
Responsible for keeping search value in global store and fetching initial search request

#### `<SearchResults />`

Represents infinyty scroll
Responsible for loading more search results. By clicking on search results item set item id as active in global state

`<UserPreview />`
Represent item details.
Responsible for loading more details by active item id.

To fetch data from API `src/services/api.ts` or change global app state, components have to dispatch specific actions from `src/store/actions`

Response from API could be in different formats so that application must to apply adapter to the response (`src/utils/adapters.ts`)

Util function `applyFileAdapters` received next parameters `(file, adapters)` where `file` is text representation of response, `adapters` is array of functions where each function is applied to the `file` to convert it to JSON in case of error next adapter is calling (from left to right)

Usage of `applyFileAdapters`:

```javascript
const json = await applyFileAdapters(textFile, [toJSON, csvToJSON, ...YourCustomAdapters])
```
